        <h1>How to Play:</h1>
        <h3>Starting the Game:</h3>

        <ul>
            <li>Turn on the Simon game.</li>
            <li>The game will randomly light up one of the four colored buttons</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Repeating the Sequence:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>After the game shows the sequence, your task is to press the buttons in the same order.</li>
            <li>If you successfully repeat the sequence, the game will add another light to the sequence.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Increasing Difficulty:</h3>

        <ul>
            <li>The game continues to add one new light to the sequence each round.</li>
            <li>Your task is to remember and repeat the entire sequence, which grows longer each round.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Making a Mistake:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>If you press the buttons in the wrong order, the game will over</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Winning:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>The game usually continues until the sequence becomes too long to remember, or until you make a mistake. Some versions might have a predefined length to reach to win.</li>
        </ul>
